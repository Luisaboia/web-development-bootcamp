<h2>Description</h2>
This course is taught by Dr. Angela Yu. We are introduced to the basics of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript before moving on to more advanced technologies like jQuery, React, APIs, etc.

<h2>My Progress</h2>

My progress will be updated with each class, I will comment on all my codes and insert some tips that I use to improve my learning.
<br />
I won't add some modules as they are highly theoretical, and there is little programming practice involved; This is not a way to make this content available for free, just a way to record my learning.

<h2>My Notes</h2>

I'll post my notes when I transfer the Udemy Notes to my OneNote on a Google Drive document. It'll be ready to ready soon.
